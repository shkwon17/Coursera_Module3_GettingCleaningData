Data Description
1. The dataset includes data collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, focusing on human activity recognition. The original dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2. The data contains recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying the smartphone.

3. The dataset is divided into training and test sets. The features represent various measurements derived from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope.

Variables
The dataset contains numerous variables, measuring different parameters of the smartphone's sensor readings during various activities. Some key variables include:

1. Subject:identifies the participant subject by a unique ID.
2. Activity:Descriptive names indicating the type of activity performed by the subjects.
3. Other variables: Measurements capturing mean and standard deviation of readings from the smartphone's sensors.

Data Transformations and Cleaning Steps
1. Step 1: Merging Datasets
- The training and test sets for features, labels, and subjects were merged into unified datasets (merged_data, merged_labels, merged_subjects).

2. Step 2: Feature Extraction
- Relevant measurements related to mean and standard deviation were extracted from the merged dataset, resulting in selected_data.

3. Step 3: Descriptive Activity Names
- Activity codes were replaced with descriptive activity names using information from activity_labels.

4. Step 4: Variable Labeling
- Descriptive variable names were assigned to the dataset columns using feature names from features, enhancing clarity in selected_data.

5. Step 5: Summarized Tidy Dataset
- A summarized tidy dataset (summarized_data) was created, containing the average of each variable for each activity using selected_data. 

Sources and File Structure
1. Data Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
2. File Structure: The dataset is organized within the UCI HAR Dataset directory.
3. Files Used: features.txt, activity_labels.txt for feature and activity information.
4. Output Files: Generated CSV files during analysis (selected_data_Step2.csv, selected_data_Step3.csv, etc.).
